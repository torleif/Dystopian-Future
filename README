=== welcome redditors ===

Dystopian Future is a 2d action adventure. It is written in python and uses pygame.

Download it, critique, modify then destroy it. Then brag about what you
did on reddit.



=== getting started ===

To play game, you'll need:
 - python
 - pygame

Portable builds are coming soon. After you download python & pygame, run:

<path to python exe> Dystopian Future/src/game.py


=== editing levels ===

Run ./editor <level no>. If you're on windows, run ./editor then select the 
level image, and then the level texture. You can see what level uses what
texture by looking in editor bash script. 

The editor is pgu's texture editor. Point and click, the hidden layer is for
code events, ie monsters and such. I've labled it with a texture so you know
what to use.


=== editing the code ===

To edit, you'll need:
 - an IDE
 - git

I use netbeans. Install the python plugin, open the project folder and you can just
press play. Otherwise you'll have to set up your own dev environment. 

At the moment portable builds won't work, the portable python VM does not 
support the garbage collector, and level includes. To make the game portable I 
included each level individually and removed the GC.

**the code is horrid.** As a computer scientist, I'm ashamed to have written it. 
Optimization is the last step of the dev process, but if you want to tidy it up
go for it.  



=== Music, sounds and SFX===

Use whatever you feel makes nice sounds.

Sound effects have been made with fruity loops and cfxr.
 - If you want to play with the fl files you'll need EDIROL Orchestral synth, CS-80V
synth, ABSYNTH 4 and gladiator. Most of these files are simply tests I haven't got 
around to fine tuning. 



=== graphics ===

The sketches are in photoshop. One file is in pixelmator. 

Most of the enemies were sketched, pixelated to 32x32 and animated.
